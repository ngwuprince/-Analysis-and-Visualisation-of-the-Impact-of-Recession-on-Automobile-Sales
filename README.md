## Analyzing the Impact of Recession on Automobile Sales

This repository contains the code and visualizations for analyzing the historical impact of recessions on automobile sales. The project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Create Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Folium

* Explore the relationship between automobile sales and recession periods using line charts and scatter plots.
* Analyze the influence of GDP, unemployment rate, consumer confidence, seasonality, price, advertising expenditure, competition, and vehicle type on automobile sales during recessions.
* Employ Folium API to create interactive maps illustrating the regional distribution of automobile sales during recessions.

### Part 2: Create Dashboard using Plotly and Dash

* Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly and Dash to visualize the key findings from Part 1.
* Enable users to filter and explore the data interactively to gain deeper insights into the impact of recessions on automobile sales.
* Design the dashboard with a user-friendly interface and clear visualizations to effectively communicate the findings to the company directors.
